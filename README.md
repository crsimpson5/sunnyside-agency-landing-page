## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Intersection Observer API
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was a great challenge for practicing responsive design. I now feel more confident creating layouts with Grid and Flexbox. I also got some practice creating CSS animations and using the Intersection Observer API.

### Useful resources
